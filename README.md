# C_Project-Shooter
First university project on C with my teammate. The Game Shooter with labirinths and view from above.

The pre-alha-version of the First Level is nearly done. Yeah, it takes a lot of memory power to print and check
for all of the pixels on the picture to make the character to move or not. But the main thing here consists
in working of the program which makes us feel happy at all!
