# C_Project-Shooter
First university project on C with my teammate. The Game Shooter with labyrinths and view from the above.

(27/05/2024):
The alpha-version of the gameplay is done. All the shooting bugs, as I think, were fixed. The collision
with the walls and "the flying function" were added and checked. Now there'll be the enemy shooting part.
